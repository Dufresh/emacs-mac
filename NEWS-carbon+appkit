* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.2 (2009-01-24)

** Fixed bugs

*** do-applescript crashes with -nw due to the previous fix for
(do-applescript "choose file") hang.

*** Cursor erasure sometimes fails on Mac OS X 10.5 due to the
previous change for flyspell-small-region slowness.

*** Buffer overrun in creation of Vmac_carbon_version_string.

** Improvements

*** Untag Lisp_Object by subtraction instead of masking.

*** `select' emulation waits for user signal delivery as well as
window system events and process outputs via sockets.
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2008-10/msg00198.html

*** Hourglass display is enabled.

*** Let the framework decide whether wheel events to non-focus frames
are accepted or not.


* emacs-22.3-appkit-1.1 (2008-11-27)

** Fixed bugs

*** 64-bit binary doesn't work with AquaSKK Japanese input method.

*** Tooltip contents are chopped off if the fractional part of the
scaling factor is greater than or equal to 0.5.

*** Crash with tooltip autodisplay that happens when its contents are
not yet ready.

*** (do-applescript "choose file") -> cancel -> hang on 10.5.

*** With asynchronous subprocesses, the "[Complete, but not unique]"
message shown by C-x C-f / TAB TAB will disappear on key release.
(Both Carbon and Carbon+Appkit)

*** Crash with tabbar.el (not specific to the Carbon(+AppKit) port).

** Improvements

*** Execution of flyspell-small-region is no longer too slow.

*** The "Visit New File" dialog no longer confirms replacement if an
existing file is specified (only on 10.3 and later).

*** Update display while the resize control (or the slider in the font
panel) is being dragged.

*** Align key bindings shown in a menu.

*** Explicitly link with libncurses.5 if MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET <
1040 to avoid runtime link error when running on the versions without
/usr/lib/libncurses.5.4.dylib.
